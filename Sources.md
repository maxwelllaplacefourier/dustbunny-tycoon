A message ferrying approach for data delivery in sparse mobile ad hoc networks
  * http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=989483
  * Currently in webpage source list

Hybrid routing in clustered DTNs with message ferrying
  * http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1247694.1247710&coll=GUIDE&dl=GUIDE&CFID=82345016&CFTOKEN=82922258
  * This one deals with node clustering - message ferrying between clusters (what I was thinking originally)

Routing in a delay tolerant network
  * http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1015484&dl=GUIDE&coll=GUIDE&CFID=82345016&CFTOKEN=82922258
  * Seems to be a really good source
